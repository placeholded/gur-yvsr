Gur yvsr is an esoteric programming language (or esolang) inspired by Brainfuck and Emmental, though it is not as confusing as either of them (it's still not easy to program in).
It is named after [the song of the same name](https://soundcloud.com/frums/gur-yvsr-kari?si=e89d2e107b8249a3b2f075d455994f43&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

Installation
---
First, make sure that Rust is installed. See https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/ for how to install Rust.

You may install this repository from source (replace `<path>` with the path to the repository):
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/placeholded/gur-yvsr
cd <path>
cargo install --path .
```
You may also install it through crates.io:
```
cargo install guryvsr
```
Note: Programs in gur yvsr must have a .gur extension.

How It Works
---
*You can find more information about this esolang on [its esolangs.org page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Gur_yvsr).*

Gur yvsr's syntax is composed of single-character commands as well as comments. Comments are surrounded by backticks (\`), like so:
```
`I will be ignored.`
```

Gur yvsr is both accumulator-based and cell-based. In other words, it features an accumulator which can hold a pointer-sized integer (32-bit on 32-bit systems and 64-bit on 64-bit systems), as well as a memory tape which also holds pointer-sized integers. Both the accumulator and tape can be read from and written to.

There is a data pointer that points to a specific location on the tape, and it starts pointing at the 0th location (cell 0).
Unlike Brainfuck, where the pointer only moves when specified, this data pointer will continuously move one position in the direction it's facing (positive or negative) after each command is executed and only stops moving for 1 command after certain commands are executed.
The pointer starts moving in the positive direction, but it can move in the negative direction as well.

A code pointer also exists; it points to a specific command in the program, starting at the very first command (index 0) and executing left to right, top to bottom. Unlike the data pointer, it cannot change direction. However, its position can be changed when executing certain commands. It is important to note that command execution occurs before the pointers move.

  <tr><td>l</td><td>the value of cell one cell in the negative direction of c</td></tr>
  <tr><td>a</td><td>the accumulator's value</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C</td><td>the cell the data pointer is pointing to</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L</td><td>the cell one cell in the negative direction of c</td></tr>

| `?`        | if                       | Checks if C is empty or if c = 0. If so, the code pointer jumps to a matching `@`. If a matching `@` does not exist, a `SyntaxError` is thrown.                                                                                                                                              | No                                |

| `T`        | targeted if              | Checks if the cell with index a is empty or if that cell's value is 0. If so, the code pointer jumps to a matching `@`. If a matching `@` does not exist, a `SyntaxError` is thrown. Additionally, an `AccumulatorError` will be thrown if A is empty. Clears A.                             | No                                |
| `t`        | targeted inverted if     | Checks if the cell with index a is not empty and if that cell's value is not 0. If so, the code pointer jumps to a matching `@`. If a matching `@` does not exist, a `SyntaxError` is thrown. Additionally, an `AccumulatorError` will be thrown if A is empty. Clears A.                    | No                                |

If a matching `@` does not exist, a `SyntaxError` is thrown.                                                                                                                                         | No                                |
| `@`        | conditional destination  | By itself, it behaves like `_`. Matches with a conditional command (`?`, `!`, `T`, `t`, `A`, `a`) to form a conditional statement. These statements can be nested.                                                                                                                           | No                                |
| `J`        | jump commands            | Makes the code pointer jump a commands forward and clears A. The command jumped to will not be executed. If the code pointer gets pushed beyond the boundaries of the program, then an `OutOfBoundsError` will be thrown.                                                                    | No                                |
| `j`        | jump to command          | Makes the code pointer jump to the ath command and clears A. The command jumped to will not be executed. If the code pointer gets pushed beyond the boundaries of the program, then an `OutOfBoundsError` will be thrown.                                                                    | No                                |
| `K`        | jump cells               | Makes the data pointer jump a cells in the positive direction and clears A. If the data pointer gets pushed beyond the boundaries of the tape (min index -2<sup>63</sup>+1 or -2<sup>31</sup>+1, max index 2<sup>63</sup>-1 or 2<sup>31</sup>-1), then an `OutOfBoundsError` will be thrown. | Yes                               |
| `k`        | jump to cell             | Makes the data pointer jump to the cell at index a on the tape and clears A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes                               |
| `F` or `f` | flip data pointer        | Flips the direction of the data pointer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | No                                |
| `M`        | move until empty         | Moves the data pointer in the direction it's moving in until C is empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Yes                               |
| `m`        | move until full          | Moves the data pointer in the direction it's moving in until C is full.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes                               |
| `+`        | add                      | Sets a to l + c. If the result is under the min pointer-sized integer value or over the max pointer-sized integer value, an `OverflowError` will be thrown. If either L or C is empty, then an `OpError` will be thrown.                                                                     | No                                |
| `-`        | negate                   | Sets a to -a. If the result is under the min pointer-sized integer value or over the max pointer-sized integer value, an `OverflowError` will be thrown. If C is empty, then an `OpError` will be thrown.                                                                                    | No                                |
| `*`        | multiply                 | Sets a to l × c. If the result is under the min pointer-sized integer value or over the max pointer-sized integer value, an `OverflowError` will be thrown. If either L or C is empty, then an `OpError` will be thrown.                                                                     | No                                |
| `/`        | divide                   | Sets a to ⌊l ÷ c⌋. If the result is under the min pointer-sized integer value or over the max pointer-sized integer value, an `OverflowError` will be thrown. If either L or C is empty or division by 0 is attempted, then an `OpError` will be thrown.                                     | No                                |
